# README  

**Repository:** `[archetypes]`  
**Description:** `[This repository has been put together to as a template repository, to support new repository creation]`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `Apache-2.0 AND OGL-UK-3.0 `  

## Overview  

This repository has been put together to support with new repository creation. When you create a new repository you can use this template, as a base to ensure you include all the standard documentation, folder structure and a few base build pipelines. 

While initially this repositories focus has been on creating a set of base template documentation files, the intent is to continue expanding this to include pipeline checks, that could help ensure documentation follows basic rules and checks through standard continuous integration (CI) validation examples in the future.

## Quick Start  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before using this repository, please keep in mind, these are just example files and everything has been outlined based on setting up a "new repository" and you are still expected to review any official guidance alongside using this content. If you are using these as a reference to help update an "existing repository" that may have been forked, you should also ensure original contributions are properly acknowledged, while also reflecting NDTP’s role as the maintainer and contributor of the fork as outlined by the official guidance. 

### 1. Create new Repository from Template

Create a new repository from this template.

### 2. Update Repository Name

All references throughout the files, that refer to the repository name `archetypes` should be replaced with the new target repository name

### 3. Update/Remove all GUIDANCE/EXAMPLE sections

Throughout all the `.md` files are some `GUIDANCE` blocks sometimes also including `EXAMPLE` sections similar that below. 

```md
<!-- 
GUIDANCE: 
 -->
```
These blocks don't appear on previews, the are just intended to help support updating the markdown file content when you first create a new repository and should be fully removed after content has been updated. 

### 4. Pull Requests

Included in this repository is an example [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), which can be used to help prompt specific content to include in pull requests by contributors. 

There are also two basic example rulesets [pr_ruleset_example_default_main.json](./.github/codepolicyexamples/pr_ruleset_example_default_main.json) and [pr_ruleset_example_develop.json](./.github/codepolicyexamples/pr_ruleset_example_default_main.json) that can be used to configure a minimal basic policy for you pull requests. The folder containing these files should be removed on any repositories as these are just for reference examples only.
